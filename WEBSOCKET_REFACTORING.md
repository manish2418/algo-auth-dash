# KotakNeo WebSocket Refactoring Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **WebSocket Message Handling**
- **Problem**: The original `onmessage` handler was trying to parse messages twice and had complex logic that could cause issues with ping message detection.
- **Solution**: Refactored message handling into separate methods:
  - `handleHSMMessage()` - Main message router
  - `handleAuthResponse()` - Handles authentication responses
  - `handlePingMessage()` - Specifically handles ping messages
  - `handleMarketData()` - Handles market data messages

### 2. **Authentication Flow**
- **Problem**: Authentication state wasn't properly tracked, leading to connection issues.
- **Solution**: 
  - Added `AUTHENTICATING` state to track authentication process
  - Added `isAuthenticated` flag to track successful authentication
  - Added authentication timeout (5 seconds)
  - Added specific callbacks for auth success/failure

### 3. **Connection State Management**
- **Problem**: Connection state was not properly managed during different phases.
- **Solution**:
  - Enhanced `SocketState` enum with `AUTHENTICATING` state
  - Improved `isConnected()` method to check authentication status
  - Better state transitions throughout the connection process

### 4. **Error Handling & Timeouts**
- **Problem**: Limited error handling and no connection timeouts.
- **Solution**:
  - Added connection timeout (10 seconds)
  - Added authentication timeout (5 seconds)
  - Added `handleConnectionError()` method for centralized error handling
  - Added `clearTimeouts()` method for proper cleanup

### 5. **Ping Message Detection**
- **Problem**: Ping messages weren't being properly detected and handled.
- **Solution**:
  - Added specific `handlePingMessage()` method
  - Added `onPing` callback to `SocketCallbacks` interface
  - Added `lastPingTime` tracking
  - Enhanced heartbeat mechanism with proper ping handling

## Key Improvements

### Enhanced Message Parsing
```typescript
// Before: Complex nested parsing
this.ws.onmessage = async (event) => {
  // Complex parsing logic with multiple conditions
}

// After: Clean message routing
this.ws.onmessage = (event) => {
  this.handleHSMMessage(event, resolve, reject);
}

private async handleHSMMessage(event: MessageEvent, resolve?, reject?) {
  // Clean switch statement for different message types
  switch (data.type) {
    case "cn": this.handleAuthResponse(data, resolve, reject); break;
    case "ti": this.handlePingMessage(data); break;
    case "data": this.handleMarketData(data); break;
    // ... other cases
  }
}
```

### Better Authentication Handling
```typescript
// Added authentication state tracking
private isAuthenticated = false;

// Added authentication timeout
this.authTimeout = setTimeout(() => {
  reject(new Error("Authentication timeout"));
}, 5000);

// Added specific auth response handling
private handleAuthResponse(data: any, resolve?, reject?) {
  if (data.stat === "Ok") {
    this.isAuthenticated = true;
    this.startHeartbeat();
    resolve();
  } else {
    reject(new Error(data.message || "Authentication failed"));
  }
}
```

### Improved Connection Management
```typescript
// Enhanced connection state checking
public isConnected(): boolean {
  return (
    this.state === SocketState.CONNECTED &&
    this.isAuthenticated &&
    this.ws?.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN
  );
}

// Better timeout management
private clearTimeouts(): void {
  if (this.connectionTimeout) {
    clearTimeout(this.connectionTimeout);
    this.connectionTimeout = null;
  }
  if (this.authTimeout) {
    clearTimeout(this.authTimeout);
    this.authTimeout = null;
  }
}
```

## New Features Added

1. **Ping Tracking**: Added `onPing` callback and ping count tracking
2. **Authentication Callbacks**: Added `onAuthSuccess` and `onAuthFailure` callbacks
3. **Connection Timeouts**: Added configurable timeouts for connection and authentication
4. **Better Logging**: Enhanced console logging throughout the connection process
5. **Test Component**: Created `WebSocketTest.tsx` for testing the connection flow

## Usage

The refactored code maintains backward compatibility while providing better error handling and connection management. The main changes are:

1. **Better Error Messages**: More descriptive error messages for debugging
2. **Ping Detection**: Ping messages are now properly detected and can be tracked
3. **Robust Connection**: Connection process is more reliable with proper timeouts
4. **Enhanced Debugging**: Better logging for troubleshooting connection issues

## Testing

Use the `WebSocketTest` component to test the connection flow:
1. Enter your Kotak Neo credentials
2. Click Connect to establish connection
3. Monitor the logs for connection status and ping messages
4. Verify that ping messages are being received every 30 seconds

The refactored code should now properly handle authentication responses and ping messages, resolving the original issue where ping messages weren't being detected despite correct authentication.
